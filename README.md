# shavit-replayrun
 - A Sourcemod plugin that allows you to replay your last run when using bhoptimer.
 - Compilied and tested with version [bhoptimer version 3.1.2](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer/releases/tag/v3.1.2)
   - Thanks to Nuko#9726 for the idea ("pretty much just get the record array by Shavit_GetReplayData when you finish the map and play it by Shavit_StartReplayFromFrameCache")
   - Thanks to Ciallo (https://github.com/Ciallo-Ani) for fixing the plugin.
## Available Commands
- sm_replayrun - Activates a replay (using the central bot) of your most recent run if the bot is idle.
